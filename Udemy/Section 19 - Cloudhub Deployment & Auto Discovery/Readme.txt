Note:-
1. The following Section 19, on cloudhub deployment and auto-discovery. A jar file: "studentfile.jar" has been provided without any module dependency.
2. I would recommend, instead of import the jar file, import the RAML from the design centre to your anypoint studio, as shown in the video.
